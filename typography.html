        relative sizes to scale based on view width, using <a href="https://grtcalculator.com/">golden-ratio</a>-esque

      <h1>Typography</h1>
      <Lt>Typography refers to the art and technique of arranging and designing type, which includes selecting
        typefaces, arranging typefaces, and organizing them in a visually pleasing and effective manner. It involves the
        creation and arrangement of letters, numbers, symbols, and other characters to form written communication,
        whether in print or digital form.</Lt>
      <h2>Elements</h2>
      <p>Typography encompasses various elements such as typefaces, fonts, point sizes, line spacing, letter spacing,
        and alignment. These elements are used to create hierarchy, readability, and aesthetic appeal in written
        communication. Typography plays a crucial role in enhancing the readability and legibility of text, conveying
        meaning and tone, and evoking emotions.</p>
      <h3>Typefaces</h3>
      <p>Typefaces, also known as fonts, are designed sets of characters with consistent visual characteristics. They
        can range from traditional serif typefaces to more modern sans-serif or decorative typefaces. Each typeface has
        its own personality and conveys a different mood or message. Typeface selection is an important aspect of
        typography as it helps establish the overall tone and visual style of the text.</p>
      <h4>Usage</h4>
      <p>Typography is utilized in various mediums such as books, magazines, newspapers, posters, websites,
        advertisements, user interfaces, and more. It involves careful consideration of factors like readability,
        legibility, alignment, spacing, and contrast to ensure that the text is clear, engaging, and visually appealing
        to the intended audience.</p>
      <p>Overall, typography is a powerful design tool that combines artistic creativity with practical functionality to
        effectively communicate through written language.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from
        his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end of it. Fleur
        Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he desisted.</p>
